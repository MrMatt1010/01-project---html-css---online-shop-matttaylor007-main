## How do you think you did?

I Think I did okay with this assignment, I am not a designer by any stretch of the imagination but I believe that the site works as it should. 

## Did you struggle with any parts of the assignment?

I struggled alot with the designing of the site by that I mean making the links and buttons look nice. If anything I think that is what will let me down if anything. I have not had much exposure to CSS grids or anything of that nature so it really threw me a curve ball or two trying to figure that out. 
I had more than a few issues with getting prettier to run correctly and that certainly held up things with regards to the auto grading system. 

## Describe what you learnt in your own words

I learned quite a bit about things like CSS grids and boxes etc, I also learned the best ways to search google for the answers to questions to get the right information. 
I have learned about effective communication and the importance of listening to advise when it is given and also not just dismissing what others have to say out of hand. 
I have also learned the importance of patience when it comes to writting html and css as simple things like capatlising something with out realising it can lead to issues further down the line. 
I think that one of my most important lessons was that it's best to work in a team everyone has different ideas and sometimes those ideas can lead you to finding the answers you need. Software development is not a solo sport. 

## Was the assignment relevant to the topics covered in the tutorial videos and meetings?

Yes the assignment was covered nicely in the videos and meetings.

## Would you like to add any other feedback?

The only feedback I would like to provide is that Aron and the team are doing a great job at helping us all through the course to date.
